          Hong Kong<br>
          For immediate release</p>
          <h2>Spring Workshop announces Ari Benjamin Meyers to bring music to arts organizations across Hong Kong</h2>
          <p><b>Ari Benjamin Meyers:</b><br>
          <i>An exposition, not an exhibition</i><br>
          March 11 – April 1, 2017</p><br>
          <p><b>***</b></p><br>
          <p>Spring Workshop is delighted to present <i>An exposition, not an exhibition</i> by American composer and artist Ari Benjamin Meyers. The exhibition held between March 11 – April 1 will take place in seven arts organizations across the city of Hong Kong.<br>
          <p>In the first location, Spring Workshop, the Hong Kong New Music Ensemble (HKNME) and their entire repertoire consisting of well over one hundred works will be specially arranged by Meyers for display in an experimental setting. The work thus offers an encyclopedic overview of and reckoning with what is commonly thought of as “contemporary music”. At the other six arts organizations – M+, Asia Art Archive, Para Site Art Space, Hong Kong Arts Center, Things that can happen and soundpocket – Meyers has commissioned new musical compositions/interventions that will be performed by staff members at their desks. Taken together, these events epitomize Meyers’ experimentation with dissolving the delineation between contemporary art and music.</p>
          <p>The title “An exposition, not an exhibition” is a play on the two meanings of the word “exposition”: in French it means “exhibition”, whereas in musical terminology, it refers to the first section of a sonata, where themes are put forward for the first time before being developed further in the next section. This wordplay expresses Meyers’ interest in considering the problems that exist with how music is presented or put on display within the setting of a contemporary art space.</p>
          <p>His new work shown at Spring, <i>Litany and Rapture</i>, features ensemble members of HKNME engaging in a demanding durational performance of their entire repertoire, which consists of international and local canonical works of contemporary music. By moving away from the predominant concert-mode of musical presentation and envisioning a non-goal-oriented musical space featuring a new kind of musical performer, the piece is a testing ground where Meyers overturns rules and protocols usually applied to presentation and appreciation of these works for both musician and audience alike.</p>
          <p>Continuing to blur the inherent division between performers, audience and insitutions, his other new work, <i>Hong Kong Solos</i>, will take place at six non-profit art organizations. At Meyers’ invitation, six local Hong Kong composers have created new commissions in close collaboration with staff members at six arts organizations across the city. In order to experience these intimate pieces devised for one performer and 1-4 audience members, potential listeners are invited to book visits to these institutions. The work centers around the coming together of two usually disparate parties: a composer and an art professional, a (sometimes amateur) perfomer and a visitor, and the (otherwise disconnected) art and music communities in Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Ari Benjamin Meyers shared: <i>An exposition, not an exhibition</i> is a program specifically created for Spring as an open research process. The show has a lot to do with the way one can collaboratively work here, how people and organisations from the local community can transcend boundaries to create cross-disciplinary meta-works. This is not necessarily typical in other places; it has a lot to do with the relationships and position of Spring Workshop within the local cultural landscape of Hong Kong. Using this as a springboard, <i>An exposition, not an exhibition</i> can experiment with how we break the old rules of music, music-making and its institutions and propose new ones.”</p>
          <p>Spring Founder Mimi Brown says: “I have waited years for the right chance to mess with the rules of music. So I look forward with anticipation to the new vantage points on the topic that Ari’s program will put forward. We wanted especially to ground this conversation locally, and appreciate the opportunity to play with music in the company of six Hong Kong composers and our fellow local arts organizations. As 2017 will be our final year of the Spring Workshop initiative, it is poetic and meaningful to dedicate ourselves to test the ground for the founding of a new experimental art institution – the <i>Kunsthalle for Music</i> – and to do so once again both with our beloved local arts family and with our trusted partners at the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art.”</p>
          <p>By both working with an existing ensemble (HKNME) and its repertoire as material, as well as by commissioning new works, <i>An exposition, not an exhibition</i> is an invitation to collectively question the modes of production, definition and experience around music. Gathering an ensemble of performers and composers from across disciplines, Meyers imagines an open space for music that exists outside of recordings and staged environments, and finds welcoming landing pads within the tightknit network of the city’s art institutions.</p>
          <p><i>An exposition, not an exhibition</i> was developed during Ari Benjamin Meyers’ two residencies at Spring Workshop in the summer and fall of 2016, and stems from his ongoing research into the essence of live musical performance and the questions surrounding its protocols for audiences, performers and institutions. This presentation showcases the first iteration of research for the Kunsthalle for Music, and will be followed at Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art (Rotterdam) by a congress in May 2017 and the inaugural exhibition of the Kunsthalle for Music in January 2018.</p><br>
